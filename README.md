Genome2D-DragonBones-extension
==============================

A simple DragonBones extension for Genome2D with examples.

You'll need to download a few dependencies to run the examples:

- DragonBones library from here[http://dragonbones.github.io/download_forwarding.html?download_url=downloads/dragonbones_v2.3.1.zip]
- LoaderMax from greensock[http://www.greensock.com/loadermax/].

This extension is tested on version 2.3.1 of dragonBones and the latest Genome2D.0.9.3.1186 build.

Look at the examples package as a starting point. The code is pretty much the same as the Starlin's demos.
I'll try to update the examples later.
